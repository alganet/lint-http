# domain_name_whitespace_or_control_forbidden

Domain name holds whitespace or a control character

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No one sentence sets this level.** Nothing states a requirement about this defect; or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported; or the message cannot show that its sender is the party the keyword binds; or the defect is reported in two places that two sentences of different strength govern, and one level has to answer for both. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [RFC 1035 §2.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035.html#section-2.3.1): Preferred name syntax — labels start with a letter, end with a letter or digit, hold only letters, digits and hyphen, and run to 63 characters

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.domain_name_whitespace_or_control_forbidden]
# Domain name holds whitespace or a control character
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [cookie_attribute_consistent](../rules/cookie_attribute_consistent.md)
