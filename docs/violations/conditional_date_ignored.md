# conditional_date_ignored

A date conditional is sent where the recipient must discard it

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [RFC 9110 §13.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-13.1.3): `If-Modified-Since`: the recipient MUST ignore it when an `If-None-Match` is present, MUST ignore it when the value is no HTTP-date or has more than one member or the method is neither GET nor HEAD, and SHOULD answer a false condition with a 304 rather than performing the method

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.conditional_date_ignored]
# A date conditional is sent where the recipient must discard it
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [conditional_headers_consistent](../rules/conditional_headers_consistent.md)
