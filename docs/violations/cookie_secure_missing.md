# cookie_secure_missing

A SameSite=None cookie is not Secure

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No one sentence sets this level.** Nothing states a requirement about this defect; or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported; or the message cannot show that its sender is the party the keyword binds; or the defect is reported in two places that two sentences of different strength govern, and one level has to answer for both. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis): `SameSite` value grammar and the `SameSite=None` requires `Secure` rule. No section: a draft renumbers between revisions

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.cookie_secure_missing]
# A SameSite=None cookie is not Secure
severity = "error"
```

## Reported By

- [cookie_attribute_consistent](../rules/cookie_attribute_consistent.md)
