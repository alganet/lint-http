# origin_agent_cluster_invalid

Origin-Agent-Cluster states a value that is not `?1`

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [HTML §7.1.2](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#origin-keyed-agent-clusters): `Origin-Agent-Cluster` — a structured-header boolean; only the `?1` true value requests an origin-keyed agent cluster

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.origin_agent_cluster_invalid]
# Origin-Agent-Cluster states a value that is not `?1`
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [origin_isolated_header_valid](../rules/origin_isolated_header_valid.md)
