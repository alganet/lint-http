# cache_control_no_cache_ignored

A no-cache response is re-requested without its validator

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [RFC 9111 §5.2.2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html#section-5.2.2.4): no-cache — the unqualified form's prohibition on reuse without forwarding for validation, the argument syntax `#field-name`, the qualified form defined as an argument listing one or more field names, and the Note that caches often handle it as an unqualified no-cache

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.cache_control_no_cache_ignored]
# A no-cache response is re-requested without its validator
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [no_cache_revalidation](../rules/no_cache_revalidation.md)
