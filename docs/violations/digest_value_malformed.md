# digest_value_malformed

Digest field member's value is not a Byte Sequence

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No one sentence sets this level.** Nothing states a requirement about this defect; or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported; or the message cannot show that its sender is the party the keyword binds; or the defect is reported in two places that two sentences of different strength govern, and one level has to answer for both. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [RFC 9530 §2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9530.html#section-2): `Content-Digest`: a Dictionary keyed by hashing algorithm whose values are Byte Sequences

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.digest_value_malformed]
# Digest field member's value is not a Byte Sequence
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [digest_header_syntax](../rules/digest_header_syntax.md)
