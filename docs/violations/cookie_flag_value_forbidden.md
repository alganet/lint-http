# cookie_flag_value_forbidden

Set-Cookie writes a value on a flag attribute

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [RFC 6265 §4.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265.html#section-4.1.1): Set-Cookie syntax — servers SHOULD NOT send a non-conforming Set-Cookie; the `cookie-av` list, where each attribute is written with or without a value, and the `path-value` that excludes control characters and `;`

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.cookie_flag_value_forbidden]
# Set-Cookie writes a value on a flag attribute
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [cookie_attribute_consistent](../rules/cookie_attribute_consistent.md)
