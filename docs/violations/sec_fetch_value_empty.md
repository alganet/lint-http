# sec_fetch_value_empty

A Sec-Fetch-* field is written with no value on it

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No one sentence sets this level.** Nothing states a requirement about this defect; or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported; or the message cannot show that its sender is the party the keyword binds; or the defect is reported in two places that two sentences of different strength govern, and one level has to answer for both. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.sec_fetch_value_empty]
# A Sec-Fetch-* field is written with no value on it
severity = "warn"
```
