# cookie_value_conflicting

A cookie carries a value the observed exchange did not set

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.cookie_value_conflicting]
# A cookie carries a value the observed exchange did not set
severity = "info"
```

## Reported By

- [cookie_lifecycle](../rules/cookie_lifecycle.md)
