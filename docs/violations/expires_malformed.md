# expires_malformed

Expires derives from no HTTP-date, so a cache reads it as already expired

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [RFC 9111 §5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html#section-5.3): `Expires` — a recipient MUST ignore it when `max-age` is present and a shared cache when `s-maxage` is, an invalid date ("0" above all) MUST be read as already expired, and the field is only intended for recipients that have not implemented Cache-Control

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.expires_malformed]
# Expires derives from no HTTP-date, so a cache reads it as already expired
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [expires_date_syntax](../rules/expires_date_syntax.md)
