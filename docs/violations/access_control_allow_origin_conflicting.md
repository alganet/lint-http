# access_control_allow_origin_conflicting

Access-Control-Allow-Origin echoes an origin that did not ask

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No one sentence sets this level.** Nothing states a requirement about this defect; or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported; or the message cannot show that its sender is the party the keyword binds; or the defect is reported in two places that two sentences of different strength govern, and one level has to answer for both. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [Fetch §4.10](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-cors-check): Fetch CORS check — `*` succeeds only where the request's credentials mode is not `include`, and every other value is compared against the byte-serialized request origin

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.access_control_allow_origin_conflicting]
# Access-Control-Allow-Origin echoes an origin that did not ask
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [origin_matching_for_cors](../rules/origin_matching_for_cors.md)
