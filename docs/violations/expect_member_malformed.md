# expect_member_malformed

Expect member holds octets the expectation production does not admit

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [RFC 9110 §10.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-10.1.1): Expect: the field's grammar, the one expectation this specification defines, and the four client requirements — of which the MUST NOT on a request without content and the SHOULD after a 417 are the two a captured message can measure

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.expect_member_malformed]
# Expect member holds octets the expectation production does not admit
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [expect_header_valid](../rules/expect_header_valid.md)
