# conditional_empty

A precondition is written with no validator in it

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.conditional_empty]
# A precondition is written with no validator in it
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [conditional_etag_syntax](../rules/conditional_etag_syntax.md)
