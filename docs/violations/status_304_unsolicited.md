# status_304_unsolicited

304 Not Modified answers a request that was not a conditional GET or HEAD whose condition was false

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No sentence obliges the sender of this message.** Either nothing states a requirement about this defect, or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Specifications

- [RFC 9110 §15.4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-15.4.5): 304 Not Modified — the fields a 304 MUST send, the SHOULD NOT against any other representation metadata unless it guides cache updates, and the response being terminated by the end of the header section

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.status_304_unsolicited]
# 304 Not Modified answers a request that was not a conditional GET or HEAD whose condition was false
severity = "warn"
```

## Reported By

- [conditional_request_handling](../rules/conditional_request_handling.md)
