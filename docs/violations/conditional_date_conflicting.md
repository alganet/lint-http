# conditional_date_conflicting

A date precondition names a time after the request's own Date

## Message

_Written where it is reported: this defect's message names the value that caused it, so it is not fixed text._

## Obligation

**No one sentence sets this level.** Nothing states a requirement about this defect; or the keyword in the text it cites binds the *recipient* and so says nothing about the peer being reported; or the message cannot show that its sender is the party the keyword binds; or the defect is reported in two places that two sentences of different strength govern, and one level has to answer for both. The severity below is a judgement, argued in the catalogue entry.

## Configuration

```toml
[violations.conditional_date_conflicting]
# A date precondition names a time after the request's own Date
severity = "info"
```

## Reported By

- [date_and_time_headers_consistent](../rules/date_and_time_headers_consistent.md)
